# RemyaVKarthikeyan's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! 


  I am a Data Science post-graduate student at the University of Salford,currently focusing on Machine Learning, Data Mining, Applied Statistics, and Data Visualization. I forayed into the stream of Data Science from  electrical engineering background. I hold a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India. I am good at technical writing, and doing research-oriented work. Currently, I am looking forward to establishing myself in the field of Data Science.

Below, you'll find some of my highlighted work :
